# Response gate configuration
# Controls when bots should respond to messages
gate:
  # Baseline probability of responding to any message
  base_prob: 0.05
  # Probability bonus when bot is directly mentioned
  mention_prob: 0.8
  # Probability bonus for question messages
  question_prob: 0.3
  # Probability bonus when conversation just started (after silence)
  conversation_start_prob: 0.4
  # Probability bonus on mode/topic changes
  mode_change_prob: 0.9
  # Decay factor applied per consecutive bot message (prevents runaway bickering)
  decay_factor: 0.5
  # Minutes of silence before considering it a new conversation
  silence_threshold_minutes: 5

# Context building configuration
context:
  # Maximum tool use rounds before forcing a summary
  max_tool_rounds: 3
  # Number of results to return from RAG search
  rag_top_k: 5

# Memory/RAG configuration
memory:
  # Enable automatic memory extraction after responses
  extraction_enabled: true
  # Threshold above which memories are always included in context
